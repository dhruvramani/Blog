I build things. Mostly during camping in front of the screen for a real long time. And sometimes, with a Soldering Iron in hand. I have been programming since the age of 14 and tinkering with electronics since the age of 13. The fascination for computers has been since I was in 1st grade, when I got my first computer as a birthday gift.

I am a member of GDG Kuwait, which is one of the most active GDG in the Middle East and have interned under an entrepreneur during Google Startup Weekend-Kuwait.
